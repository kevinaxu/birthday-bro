Converting from .vcf to well-formatted .txt: 
- Format of .vcf 
	BEGIN:VCARD
	VERSION:2.1
	N:Matthews;Norman;;;
	FN:Norman Matthews
	TEL;CELL;PREF:5167706468
	END:VCARD
- Removed all lines that didn't beign with 'FN:' or 'TEL'. 
- Pasted the lines together: (this didn't really work when i did it) 
	- 'paste -d , - - < contacts.txt' 
- Removed the unnecessary substring and replace it with a comma.
	- "sed -e 's/ TEL;CELL;PREF:/, /' temp.txt" 

- Format of file file:
	'Norman Matthews, 5167706468
	Oli Olafson, 9172399649'
